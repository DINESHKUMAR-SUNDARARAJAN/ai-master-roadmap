# GPT Agent Enhancement – Week 3 Final Update

This update includes major improvements to the GPT-powered agent, making it more intelligent, memory-efficient, and personalized. The key updates revolve around **tool execution stability**, **long-term memory summarization**, and **consistent agent persona**.

---

## Tool Error Handling & Execution Logging

- Added robust `try/except` handling around all tool invocations
- Captured and returned tool errors as `FunctionMessage`, ensuring GPT doesn't break
- Enhanced debug logs with:
  - Tool name
  - Passed arguments
  - Success or failure messages

## Memory Summarization

To prevent exceeding token limits and improve GPT performance:
- Introduced a MAX_MEMORY_LENGTH threshold (e.g., 12 messages)
- When memory exceeds limit:
  - Automatically summarize with GPT-4o
  - Replace full message history with a single SystemMessage summary
- Keeps the conversation lean and relevant

## Persona-Based GPT Behavior

You are Jarvis, a helpful, polite, and technically competent AI trained on internal engineering handbooks.

### Always:
- Speak clearly and concisely
- Format using markdown for clarity
- Avoid referring to yourself as an AI or LLM

### Effect:
- GPT maintains a consistent tone and formatting
- Responses feel more human and aligned with your brand/voice
- No accidental slips like “As an AI model…”
